## Concept
Twilight Imperium with fewer systems and simultaneous actions. Gameplay is focused on combat, diplomacy, and economics. Movement and positioning is basically removed.



## Mechanics
Instead of command tokens, players have cards which are restored at the beginning of each round (called the strategy phase). When they play a card during a round, they cannot play it again that round unless they get it back somehow.

Each turn of an action phase, every player simultaneously and secretely commits two cards from their hand (fleet moves or abilities) then then get resolved at the same time.



## Setup
* 1 two way hyperlane with 3, 4 base, +1 wormhole with 5+ players, +1 res home with 6
* system numbers
* create 2 fleet in home system: (2 cruiser 1 carrier) + (1 destroyer 1 carrier) + (3 infantry 2 fighters)
* deal 1 secret obj each player
* reveal 2 public obj
* deal 4 ship tech each player
* show 4 public tech



## Scattered and Regrouped Forces
When your forces retreat, they are assigned to the Scattered Forces pool. At the end of each round, all scattered go to the regrouped forces pool. Units in the regrouped forces pool may be built at no resource cost during production. They still impact the produce limit.



## Scrap Pool
Units that die are moved here. At the end of the round, the owner earns 50% of the value rounded down as Goods and removes the units.



## Technologies
6 public techs drawn randomly and available this game
each player handed 4 random unique unit techs only they can get
Flagships and warsuns are not buildable without special unit tech



## Quick Rules
* max 1 fleet per system per player
* max 2 structures per planet
* ships must be in a fleet
* resources respawn on planets at the beginning of each round and may be spent. Goods are resources that sit in your storage vault and can be traded. Goods may be used in place of resources always.
* all ground forces must land on planets AFTER invasions if able
* resolve one public objective end of round, one secret objective during the round
* can never attack home systems
* planets have money placed onto them at the beginning of the round, until you spend the money from the planet, anyone can spend it/take
* during the strategy phase your resources value is set to 2 per planet
* influence does not exist
* promisory notes do not exist
* some primary strategy cards have no secondary card associated
* during agenda phase each player places typically one vote for a Leader, that leader then reveals agenda and decides outcome


## Traits
* COMBAT - Rolls dice during combat, where X or less is a hit. X are the odds out of 10 for a hit.
* CARRIED - May be moved around by units with Capacity. Carried units in space that do not have enough Capacity are destroyed.
* GROUND-AREA - Must reside on a planet at the end of each phase if there is a friendly planet available.
* SPACE-AREA - Must always be in a system. May not land on planets.
* STRUCTURE - Placed in one area and may not move. May be assigned combat hits.
* FAST - During the retreat step, one additional FAST ship may retreat.
* BOMBARD - Lets units shoot into in nearby combat. This unit may fire in every space-area AND ground-area combat round that occurs in its system, but the unit may only absorb hits if the combat is in its combat area.
* SUSTAIN DAMAGE - Each battle, may cancel one hit.
* FIRST-STRIKE - Fires one initial volley before the combat rounds. Units destroyed by them do not fire back. May combine with the Bombard trait.
* SHIELD - Each combat round, each shield may cancel one hit caused by the Bombard trait.

## Anomalies
* Trade Route - This anomaly acts like a planet with resources, where the owner is the player with a fleet in the system.
* Nebula - All units have +1 Combat value (+10% chance of hitting)
* Alpha Wormhole - One additional ship may retreat each retreat phase
* Magnetar - Each combat round, one unit may roll one additional die
* Gravity Rift - Fleets in this system may move to any other system.
