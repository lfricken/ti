## Concept
Twilight Imperium with fewer systems and simultaneous actions. Gameplay is focused on combat, diplomacy, and economics. Movement and positioning is basically removed.



## Mechanics
Instead of command tokens, players have cards which are restored at the beginning of each round (called the strategy phase). When they play a card during a round, they cannot play it again that round unless they get it back somehow.

Each turn of an action phase, every player simultaneously and secretely commits two cards from their hand (fleet moves or abilities) then then get resolved at the same time.



## Setup
* 1 two way hyperlane with 3, 4 base, +1 wormhole with 5+ players, +1 res home with 6
* system numbers
* create 2 fleet in home system: (2 cruiser 1 carrier) + (1 destroyer 1 carrier) + (3 infantry 2 fighters)
* deal 1 secret obj each player
* reveal 2 public obj
* deal 4 ship tech each player
* show 4 public tech

## Fleet Actions
The board has 7 primary systems: Mecatol in center and 6 surrounding. Then a hex for each home system which is not connected to the board directly. You have a card for each of the primary ones (1 through 6 and center), and one for _your_ home system. Notice you cannot move into other players home systems. During tactical actions you select two cards, representing a Fleet number and a Destination. 

When electing to load or not, any CARRIED units, the order is (clock wise speaker last) CWSL which is the order for every ordering that could matter.

If fleets land in the same system, they have combat where ships roll based on their combat value. At the end of each battle round, after hits have been assigned and ship destroyed, on both sides, one ship with the FAST trait and any other ship may decide to retreat (CWSL).

After any space combat, you may commit forces to one planet for a ground invasion.



## Scattered and Regrouped Forces
When your forces retreat, they are assigned to the Scattered Forces pool. At the end of each round, all scattered go to the regrouped forces pool. Units in the regrouped forces pool may be built at no resource cost during production. They still impact the produce limit.



## Scrap Pool
Units that die are moved here. At the end of the round, the owner earns 50% of the value rounded down as Goods and removes the units.



## Technologies
6 public techs drawn randomly and available this game
each player handed 4 random unique unit techs only they can get
Flagships and warsuns are not buildable without special unit tech

## Traits

* GROUND-AREA - Must reside on a planet at the end of each phase if there is a friendly planet available.
* SPACE-AREA - Must always be in a system. May not land on planets.
* STRUCTURE - Placed in one area and may not move. May be assigned combat hits.
* FAST - During the retreat step, one additional FAST ship may retreat.
* BOMBARD - Lets units shoot into in nearby combat. This unit may fire in every space-area AND ground-area combat round that occurs in its system, but the unit may only absorb hits if the combat is in its combat area.
* SUSTAIN DAMAGE - Each battle, may cancel one hit.
* FIRST-STRIKE - Fires one initial volley before the combat rounds. Units destroyed by them do not fire back. May combine with the Bombard trait.
* SHIELD - Each combat round, each shield may cancel one hit caused by the Bombard trait.
