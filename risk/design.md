## Design
Reduce player decisions after the fact of picking cards. This prevents order dependencies. Also consider variables in flux at a phase, and prevent input variables from changing.

Variables:
* Commodities
* Trade Goods
* Planet Control
* Ships
* Fleet Cards



## Tactical Variables
Variables that can change during the tactical action, and thus cards that depend on these need to be not available for play, otherwise order dependency matters.

* Unit Position and Presence



## Ability Variables
Variables that can change during the ability action, and thus cards that depend on these from other players need to be not available for play, otherwise order dependency matters.

* Units can be built in a controlled system
* commodities and trade goods (Trade II)
* fleet cards expended
* objectives scored/revealed
* technologies



## Other Ideas
* action card - scry upcoming objectives
* secret obj - participate in combat with 2 or more other players
* action card __Sabotage__ - commit system PDS units may not fire in that system remainder of this round
* action card __Interference Matrix__ - commit system Anomalies in that system have no effect until the beginning of the next round
* action card  __Warp Lock__ - commit system No player may retreat from that system for remainder of the round
* action card __Micro Wormhole__ - commit system Any fleet of yours commit that system during fleet actions this round
