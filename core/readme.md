## Tood
make map have just 7 tiles PLUS home base total
How do we solve teams running past eachother? If they pass the same boundary, 


## Concept
Game board is cut down to a small number of systems. Gameplay is focused on combat, diplomacy, and economics, movement and positioning is basically removed.

## Mechanics
Instead of command tokens, players have cards which are restored during strategy phase. When they play a card during a round, they cannot play it again that round unless they get it back somehow.

Each turn every player simultaneously picks a card from their hand (tactics or abilities) then then get resolved.



## Play Phases
    Strategy Phase - Pick cards

    { Action Phase
        Abilities 1 Begin - play ability cards
        Tactics 1 - play a from and to card
        Abilities 2
        Tactics 2
        Abilities 3
        Tactics 3
        Abilities 4 End
    }

    Status Phase - Return fleet cards you have on the board to your hand
    Agenda Phase



## Tactical Actions
The board has 7 primary systems: Mecatol in center and 6 surrounding. Then a hex for each home system which is not connected to the board directly. You have a card for each of the primary ones, and one for _your_ home system. During tactical actions you select two cards, representing a Source and a Destination. You typically cannot select two primary systems. Rather, your ships must move back and forth between your home and primary systems unless they have the FAST trait. FAST ships can move to the Destination if they are adjacent, regardless of whether they are in the Source system.



## Quick Rule Changes
planets are never exhausted and can be used repeatedly during a round
during the strategy phase your resources value is set to 2 per planet
influence does not exist
commodity on faction card only applies to replenish event, you get that many, there is no limit
promisory trade card only applies to getting the replenish amount
PDS fires on ships activating the system
Strategy cards come in two varieties, primaries and secondaries. Primaries can only be picked by one player, but everyone else may choose to pick a copy of the secondary. When a primary is played, the other players do not play the secondary, rather you can think of secondaries as just a weaker version of the strategy card that you cannot also play if you get the strategy card.




Each Select 1 Strategy primary
Each select 2 secondaries
Collect all your fleet cards


Let each player take up to 3 tactical fleet moves and 4 actions alternating, start and end with abilities. 1 of the actions is likely a strategy card.

## Strategy Cards : Primaries and Secondaries
These are treated as abilities. During the Strategy Phase you go in a circle where you all at once pick one Primary Card and two Secondary cards, or three Secondary Cards. The symbol `::::` means you cannot pick both the Primary Card and the Secondary Card, you must pick one or neither. As your last ability for the round, you may use any from your hand or any Primary Card you have not used this round. You cannot pick multiples of Secondary cards.


Construct New Fleet - Put a new fleet marker on the board and build units into it. This fleet cannot move this round since you don't have the fleet card in your hand! You could put it into your hand with the Warfare card though!


### Primaries (with ordering):
* __Trade__ - gain 3 trade goods, then choose up to any 3 players to Replenish commodity ::::
* __Industry__ - spend any number of resources and gain 1 commodity and 1 trade good for every 2 spent this way.
