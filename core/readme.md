## Concept
Twilight Imperium with fewer systems and simultaneous actions. Gameplay is focused on combat, diplomacy, and economics. Movement and positioning is basically removed.



## Mechanics
Instead of command tokens, players have cards which are restored at the beginning of each round (called the strategy phase). When they play a card during a round, they cannot play it again that round unless they get it back somehow.

Each turn of an action phase, every player simultaneously and secretely commits two cards from their hand (fleet moves or abilities) then then get resolved at the same time.



## Setup
* 1 two way hyperlane with 3, 4 base, +1 wormhole with 5+ players, +1 res home with 6
* system numbers
* create 2 fleet in home system: (2 cruiser 1 carrier) + (1 destroyer 1 carrier) + (3 infantry 2 fighters)
* deal 1 secret obj each player
* reveal 2 public obj
* deal 4 ship tech each player
* show 6 public tech



## Play Phases
    Strategy Phase - Pick cards

    { Action Phase
        Abilities 1 Begin - play ability cards
        Fleet 1 - play a from and to card
        Abilities 2
        Fleet 2
        Abilities 3
        Fleet 3
        Abilities 4 End
    }

    Status Phase - Return fleet cards you have on the board to your hand, reveal objs
    Trade and trade Phase - elect one player, they do one random agenda power



## Fleet Actions
The board has 7 primary systems: Mecatol in center and 6 surrounding. Then a hex for each home system which is not connected to the board directly. You have a card for each of the primary ones (1 through 6 and center), and one for _your_ home system. Notice you cannot move into other players home systems. During tactical actions you select two cards, representing a Fleet number and a Destination. 

When electing to load or not, any CARRIED units, the order is (clock wise speaker last) CWSL which is the order for every ordering that could matter.

If fleets land in the same system, they have combat where ships roll based on their combat value. At the end of each battle round, after hits have been assigned and ship destroyed, on both sides, one ship with the FAST trait and any other ship may decide to retreat (CWSL).

After any space combat, you may commit forces to one planet for a ground invasion.



## Scattered and Regrouped Forces
When your forces retreat, they are assigned to the scattered forces pool. At the end of each round, all scattered go to the regrouped forces pool. Units in the regrouped forces pool may be built at no resource cost during production. They still impact the produce limit.



## Scrap Pool
Units that die are moved here. At the end of the round, the owner earns 50% of the value rounded down as Goods and removes the units.



## Technologies
6 public techs drawn randomly and available this game
each player handed 4 random unique unit techs only they can get
Flagships and warsuns are not buildable without special unit tech



## Strategy Phase
First, each MAY select 1 Strategy primary OR 1 secondary
Each select 4 secondaries (or faction specific secondary ability card)
Then collect all your fleet cards for fleets you have on the board



## Quick Rules
* only commit forces from fleet onto up to one planet per fleet phase
* all ground forces must land on planets AFTER invasions if able
* commodity does not exist, Trade Goods now called Goods
* max 5 major ships per fleet
* max 1 fleet per system per player
* resolve one public objective end of round, one secret objective during the round, at end of any phase during the action phase
* can never attack home systems
* no flagships or warsuns without specific tech
* planets have money placed onto them at the beginning of the round, until you spend the money from the planet, anyone can spend it/take
* during the strategy phase your resources value is set to 2 per planet
* influence does not exist
* promisory notes do not exist
* some primary strategy cards have no secondary card associated
* during agenda phase each player places typically one vote for a Leader, that leader then reveals agenda and decides outcome
* you can only trade with special cards; You can trade Goods, Unresearched Unit Tech, Research Points, Ability Cards
* you cannot have multiple tech versions War Suns, Flagships, or Mechs, recycle them if you do



## Strategy Cards : Primaries and Secondaries
Order always goes: clockwise speaker last if any player wants to wait for another before taking their action. So a player can delay their action until it is their "turn" players that would go after them may choose to go before. You can otherwise resolve things in any order.
These are treated as abilities. During the Strategy Phase you go in a circle where you all at once pick one Primary Card and two Secondary cards, or three Secondary Cards. The symbol `::::` means you cannot pick both the Primary Card and the Secondary Card, you must pick one or neither. As your last ability for the round, you may use any from your hand or any Primary Card you have not used this round. You cannot pick multiples of Secondary cards.


Construct New Fleet - Put a new fleet marker on the board and build units into it. This fleet cannot move this round since you don't have the fleet card in your hand! You could put it into your hand with the Warfare card though!
