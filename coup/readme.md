## OVERVIEW
1. This is an expansion of the game Coup, where Influence replaces money. Agents are the hidden cards with special abilities
1. The last surviving player wins.
1. Players are eliminated when they have no Influence on any planet OR they would lose an Agent but have none left.
1. Planets have special abilities that are gained upon capture. Planets are captured when only one player has influence on it.
1. Players use fleets to remove influence on planets.
1. Special Benefit cards exist on planets and in players hands. If a player is the sole


## CARDS
* Agents - Similar to Coup ability cards.
* Benefits - One per planet, to be gained for control. And one to each player, to be gained for completing your Secret Objective.
* Secret Objectives - You start the game with one. Upon satisfying the requirements, gain your secret benefit.
* Fleet - Contain a random number in the range [3,9] which decides how many dice you get during liars dice combat.


## SETUP
1. Place planets: count is 4 + 1 for Each player beyond 4
1. Place a random Benefit card, revealed, next to each planet
1. Players get 4 influence tokens to place among planets of their choice going clockwise, placing 1 each turn. Max 1 per planet in this phase.
1. Players start with:
* 2 random Fleets
* 2 random Agents
* a random Secret Objective 
* a random Secret Benefit


## COMMON POWERS LIST
1. Move: Deploy, Replace, or Retract a Fleet. When deploying, place it last in line for fleet priority.
1. Construct: Take the top fleet card
1. Enforce: At EACH of your fleet locations, you may choose to start a Conflict
1. Denounce: Spend 2 influence tokens and pick a player to lose an Agent


## AGENT POWERS LIST
1. Commander: Take 3 fleets from the fleet deck. Put them on top or bottom in any order, keep one.
1. Strike:  Take influence from a planet your fleet orbits (no voting)
1. Mole: Block assassination
1. Saboteur: Examine any deployed fleet. You may force the owning player to: discard it and replace it with the top fleet deck card 
1. Investigator: Pick a player with Agents. Examine a random one of theirs, and draw a new agent from the deck. Choose one for them to keep and one to discard.


## CONFLICT
* Short: Players with fleets vote or abstain to remove influence. Disagreements cause combat which is resolved via single elimination Liars Dice. Losers lose influence and their fleet.
* Detailed: When a Conflict starts at a planet: the initiating player moves their fleet to the top of the fleet priority list of this planet, shifting the rest downward. Going clockwise, starting with the initiating player, players with fleets may elect any player to lose influence. Go clockwise once more to allow players to change their decision, including to abstain or not. Once each player has had 2 chances to vote, resolve the Conflict via Combat.


## COMBAT
* Each player that is not abstaining reveals their fleet strength. They participate in modified rounds of liars dice until the remaining players have no disagreements. Once the conflict is entirely resolved, eliminated players lose their fleet and forfeit their influence on the planet to the highest priority fleet owner. The voted player also loses their influence to them.
1. The starting player of each round is the one with highest fleet priority
1. A player that would lose a dice is immediately eliminated
1. In reverse clockwise order from the last player, ANY participating player may claim liar or pass. Then the next player may take their turn.

Planets with special abilities. You execute the special ability IFF you gain the planet. You gain the planet if you are the only one with influence on it.


## NOTES:
1. When a planet is captured for the first time, the player with influence gains the Benefit.
1. You can only have one of your fleets on any given planet.
1. The phrase Examine means to secretly read. You cannot show the card to others.


## EXAMPLE:
1. The Red player has a fleet card here. Only they know its strength.
1. The Blue player has a fleet of strength 8 here. This is known to everyone, as it is already revealed.
1. Even though Red controls this planet, and has already gained the Benefit, (described below the planet) they can still have their influence removed by the Green fleet.
1. Blue controls this planet, but would lose the benefit if their influence gets removed from it, since the Benefit is not a one time event.
