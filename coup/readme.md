## CARDS & TERMS

1. Insurgents: Spend a Stored Influence and place a Planetary Influence of yours on any planet.


## OUST LEADERS
* Short: Players with fleets vote or abstain to remove Planetary Influence. Disagreements cause combat which is resolved via single elimination Liars Dice. Losers lose Planetary Influence and their fleet.
* Detailed: When a Conflict starts at a planet: the initiating player moves their fleet to the top of the fleet priority list of this planet, shifting the rest downward. Going clockwise, starting with the initiating player, players with fleets may elect any player to lose Planetary Influence. Go clockwise once more to allow players to change their decision, including to abstain or not. Once each player has had 2 chances to vote, resolve the Conflict via Combat.


## COMBAT
* Each player that is not abstaining reveals their fleet strength. They participate in modified rounds of liars dice until the remaining players have no disagreements. Once the conflict is entirely resolved, take all Planetary Influence from eliminated players and the voted player. It is given to the highest priority fleet owner as Stored Influence.
1. The starting player of each round is the one with highest fleet priority
1. A player that would lose a dice is immediately eliminated
1. In reverse clockwise order from the last player, ANY participating player may claim liar or pass. Then the next player may take their turn.

You gain the planet benefit if you are the only one with Planetary Influence on it.


## NOTES:
1. A player beginning their turn with 5 or more Stored Influence MUST Denounce.
1. When a planet is captured, the player with Planetary Influence gains the Benefit. Persistent benefits can be recaptured, while discarded benefits cannot.
1. You can only have one of your fleets on any given planet.
1. The phrase Examine means to secretly read. You cannot show the card to others unless it was already revealed.


## EXAMPLE:
1. The Red player has a fleet card here. Only they know its strength.
1. The Blue player has a fleet of strength 8 here. This is known to everyone, as it is already revealed.
1. Even though Red controls this planet, and has already gained the Benefit, (described below the planet) they can still have their Planetary Influence removed by the Green fleet.
1. Blue controls this planet, but would lose the benefit if their Planetary Influence gets removed from it, since the Benefit is not a one time event.

find out staples card stock printing
condense to printables
create card backs
