## SETUP

1. Investigator: Pick a player with Agents and examine a random one of theirs, and draw a new agent from the deck. Choose one for them to keep and one to discard.


## CONFLICT
* Short: Players with fleets vote or abstain to remove influence. Disagreements cause combat which is resolved via one round Liars Dice. Losers lose influence and their fleet.
* Detailed: When a Conflict starts at a planet: the initiating player moves their fleet to the top of the fleet priority list of this planet, shifting the rest downward. Going clockwise, starting with the initiating player, players with fleets may elect any player to lose influence. Go clockwise once more to allow players to change their decision, including to abstain or not. Once each player has had 2 chances to vote, resolve the Conflict: Each player that is not abstaining reveals their fleet strength and participates in a modified game of liars dice until the remaining players have no disagreements. Once the conflict is entirely resolved, eliminated players lose their fleet and forfeit their influence on the planet to the highest priority


## COMBAT LIARS DICE CHANGES:
1. A player that would lose a dice is immediately eliminated
