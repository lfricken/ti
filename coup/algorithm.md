# Sequence of Play

First, shuffle all cards and systems into piles

## Empire Setup
1. Place a home system near you
1. Draw 1 setup card and fulfill it, then discard
1. Draw 1 Agreement pair
1. Draw 1 secret objective
1. Draw 1 of each basic action card
1. Draw 1 of each fleet card
1. Draw 1 of each system card


## Board Setup
1. Place a random system in a line for each empire in the game
1. Give them random anomalies and legends
1. Place 4 stage 1 objectives, and 4 stage 2 objectives
1. Reveal first 2 public obj
1. Reveal 4 public tech


## Action Step
For each step, you play a pair of cards face down, then everyone reveals them and resolves simultaneously.
1. Ability Card
1. Fleet Card
1. Ability Card
1. Fleet Card
1. Ability Card


## Status Phase
1. Pick up fleet and basic ability cards
1. Move scattered forces pool
1. Replenish planet resources and research
1. Reveal next public objective



## Fleet Step
1. Each empire loads any desired ground forces from local planets into their fleet
1. Fleets are placed in the target system
1. __Space Combat__ occurs until there is one or zero fleets left in the system
1. The remaining fleet may start one __Ground Combat__



## Space Combat
1. A fleet shoots at the first fleet that is both in its system, and whos owner is sitting clockwise
1. Shots are made with 6 sided dice and hit on a 5 or more
1. Shooting is simultaneous
1. At the end of each round of shooting, empires may optionally pick 2 units to retreat to Scattered Forces



## Ground Combat
1. The invader places an optional number of forces on the planet from the fleet
1. At the end of each round of shooting, the attacker may optionally pick 1 unit to retreat to system space



## Produce Step
1. Units in Regrouped Forces may be produced for free
1. The number of units produced is limited to the production value (typically 4)
1. Units may be placed in any fleet, or a new fleet if one is available
1. You may spend resources from planets or your Vault



## Anomalies
* Trade Route - Acts like a planet with resources. The owner is the empire with a fleet.
* Nebula - This system may not be moved to from the Home system
* Alpha Wormhole - One additional ship may retreat each retreat phase
* Asteroids - Each fleet ignores the first two hits during space combat
* Magnetar - Each combat round, fire two additional dice
* Gravity Rift - Fleets in this system may move to any other system.



## Gotchas
1. Limit 7 ships per fleet, no ground forces limit
1. Limit 2 PDS per planet
1. Limit 1 invasion per system per fleet phase
1. Limit 1 fleet in the same system, except your home system
1. Fleets can move from Home to any system, but otherwise only to adjacent systems
1. To own a planet, you must have a ground force on it
1. Any unit participating in ground combat can be destroyed during it
1. You may only trade with card abilities
1. Both the Signatory and Agreement cards may be traded. So a player could resell an Agreement they obtained from the Signatory. The Signatory could sell their end of the agreement as well.
