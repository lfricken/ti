How do we solve teams running past eachother? If they pass the same boundary, 


## Concept
Each player simultaneously commits to an action, which is either to move a fleet in a direction or use an ability (action card, strategy card, faction ability, etc.) Players now are doing things 100% of the time. These alternate a certain number of times.

## Mechanics
Instead of command tokens, players have cards. When they play a card during a round, they cannot play it again unless they get it back somehow. Generally everyone can only play a limited number of cards to limit exponential growth (you can only make use of so much stuff). You 

## Play Phases
    Strategy Phase - Pick cards

    { Action Phase
        Abilities 1 Begin - play ability cards
        Tactics 1 - play fleet, direction, and tactical modifier cards
        Abilities 2
        Tactics 2
        Abilities 3
        Tactics 3
        Abilities 4 End
    }

    Status Phase - Return fleet cards you have on the board to your hand
    Agenda Phase


## Quick Rule Changes
activation tokens mean you can't move a fleet INTO the system, you can still move out of it
planets are never exhausted
during the strategy phase your resources value is set to 2 per planet
influence does not exist
commodity on faction card only applies to replenish event, you get that many, there is no limit
promisory trade card only applies to getting the replenish amount
PDS fires on ships activating the system
Strategy cards come in two varieties, primaries and secondaries. Primaries can only be picked by one player, but everyone else may choose to pick a copy of the secondary. When a primary is played, the other players do not play the secondary, rather you can think of secondaries as just a weaker version of the strategy card that you cannot also play if you get the strategy card.




Each Select 1 Strategy primary
Each select 2 secondaries
Collect all your fleet cards


Let each player take up to 3 tactical fleet moves and 4 actions alternating, start and end with abilities. 1 of the actions is likely a strategy card.

## Strategy Cards : Primaries and Secondaries
These are treated as abilities. During the Strategy Phase you go in a circle where you all at once pick one Primary Card and two Secondary cards, or three Secondary Cards. The symbol `::::` means you cannot pick both the Primary Card and the Secondary Card, you must pick one or neither. As your last ability for the round, you may use any from your hand or any Primary Card you have not used this round. You cannot pick multiples of Secondary cards.


Construct New Fleet - Put a new fleet marker on the board and build units into it. This fleet cannot move this round since you don't have the fleet card in your hand! You could put it into your hand with the Warfare card though!


### Primaries (with ordering):
* __Trade__ - gain 3 trade goods, then choose up to any 3 players to Replenish commodity ::::
